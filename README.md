A semester-long project completed in a 2D Computer Graphics course at UNC Chapel Hill.

From the course description:
"Fundamentals of modern software graphics, and how these can be efficiently implemented in C/C++. Core topics to include geometric primitives, scan conversion, clipping, transformations, compositing, texture sampling. Advanced topics may include gradients, antialiasing, filtering, parametric curves, geometric stroking. Students will develop a graphics engine, evaluated for functionality, clarity, and performance."
